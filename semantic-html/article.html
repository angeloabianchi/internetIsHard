<!-- 4. HEADERS -->
<!-- not to be confused with headings (the <h1>-<h6> elements).
     It denotes introductory content for a section, article, or entire web page.
     “Introductory content” can be anything from your company’s logo to navigational
     aids or author information.
     It’s a best practice to wrap a website’s name/logo and main navigation in a <header> -->

    <header>
      <h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>

  <!-- 3. NAV ELEMENTS -->
  <!-- Lets you mark up the various navigation sections of your website. This goes
       for the main site navigation, links to related pages in a sidebar, tables
       of content, and pretty much any group of links.
       It’s possible to include multiple <nav> elements on a single page if you
       have different sets of related links.-->
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li><a href='#'>Home</a></li>
          <li><a href='#'>About</a></li>
          <li><a href='#'>Blog</a></li>
          <li><a href='#'>Sign Up</a></li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
    </header>


<!-- 1. ARTICLES -->
<!-- It should only wrap content that can be plucked out of your page and
     distributed in a completely different context.
     <article>’s are essentially mini web pages in your HTML document. They have
     their own headers, footers, and document outline that are completely isolated
     from the rest of your site. -->
<!-- MULTIPLE ARTICLE ELEMENTS: A good example is a page that displays a bunch
     of blog posts.Each one of them can be wrapped in a separate set of <article>
     tags -->

      <h1>Semantic HTML</h1>
      <p>By Troy McClure. Published January 3rd</p>
      <p>This is an example web page explaining HTML5 semantic markup.</p>


<!-- 2. SECTIONS -->
<!-- The <section> element is sort of like an <article>, except it doesn’t need
     to make sense outside the context of the document. Think of <section> as an
     explicit way to define the sections in a document outline.
     you need a container to wrap a section for layout purposes, and it makes
     sense to use the more descriptive <section> element over a generic <div>.-->
      <section>
        <h2>The Document Outline</h2>
        <p>HTML5 includes several “sectioning content” elements that
           affect the document outline.</p>

        <h3>Headers</h3>
        <p>The <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> element is one such sectioning
           element.</p>

        <h3>Footers</h3>
        <p>And so is the <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> element.</p>

        <!-- <SECTION> AND THE DOCUMENT OUTLINE -->
        <!-- By adding those <section> elements, we’re telling the document
        outline that it should be defined by the nesting structure of the
        <section> elements instead of the heading levels. This basically means
        that each <section> can have its own set of <h1> through <h6> headings
        that are independent of the rest of the page.
        You shouldn’t use the <section> element to manipulate the document outline
        in this way because browsers, screen readers, and some search engines don’t
        properly interpret the effect of <section> on the document outline.-->
        <section>
          <h2>Inline Semantic HTML</h2>
          <p>The <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> element is semantic, but it’s not
             sectioning content.</p>
        </section>

      </section>

<!-- 5. FOOTER -->
<!-- footers are basically the same as headers, except they generally come at
end of an article/website opposed to the beginning. Common use cases include
things like copyright notices, footer navigation, and author bios at the end of
blog posts.
Footers behave the same as <header> in that they’re associated with the nearest
sectioning element.-->
      <footer>
        <p>This fake article was written by somebody at InternetingIsHard.com, which
           is a pretty decent place to learn how to become a web developer.</p>

<!-- SUMMARY -->
<!-- To understand why this is important, we really have to empathize with the
machines reading our content. Before semantic HTML was a thing, developers used
a bunch of <div>’s with different and somewhat arbitrary class names to define
the structure of their pages. For example, all of the following elements are
logical names for a site-wide header:

<div class='main-menu'>
<div class='top-nav'>
<div class='top-banner'>
<div class='header'>


 Machine readers used to have to make sense of all the above <div>’s and more.
 The new semantic HTML elements we learned in this chapter are like standardized
 versions of these class names. Now, they can simply look for a <header> element.
 We can still add whatever class name we want to it for styling purposes, but search
 engines and screen readers now have a predictable way to identify headers across
 every HTML5 website on the Internet. -->
