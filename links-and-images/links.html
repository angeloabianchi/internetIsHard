    <h1>Links</h1>
    <p>This example is about links and <a href='images.html'>images</a>.</p>

    <p>This particular page is about links! There are three kinds of links:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Absolute Links -</strong> are the most retailed way you can refer to a web resource. Starts with "http://" or "https://" followed by the domain name of the website, then the path.<br/>
      Absolute links, like to <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML'>Mozilla Developer Network</a>, which is a very good resource for web developers.</li>
      <li><strong>Relative Links -</strong> point to another file in your website from the vantage point of the file you're editing. The only thing you need to supply is the path.<br/>
        Relative links, like to our <a href='misc/extras.html'>extras page</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Root-Relative Links -</strong> are similar to relative links, but instead of being relative to the current pagem they're relative to the "root" of the entire website.<br/>
      The only difference between a root-relative link and a relative one is that the former <em>starts</em> with a forward slash (/), that represent the root of your site.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Link Targets</h3>
    <p><"a"> elements also accept a <em>target</em> attribute that defines where to display the page when the user clicks the link. We can use the <em>target</em> attribute to ask the browser to open a link in a new window/tab.</p>
    <p>This is a example of target to open at a new window/tab: <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML' target='_blank'>Mozilla Developer Network</a></p>
